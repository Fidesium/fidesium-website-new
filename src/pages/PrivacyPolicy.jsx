					<p>Performing our obligations under a contract with you, or making pre-contract arrangements with you.</p>
					<p>Legal and regulatory compliance.</p>
					<p>Our legitimate business interests, and those of our customers. We rely on our legitimate business interests, and those of our customers, to process your personal data.

					<p>In some cases where we send you promotional material by email we obtain your consent as a legal basis to processing your personal data.</p>
					<h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>

						<li>
							<p>if we have your permission to do so;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may access and use your personal data;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>other companies in our M group of companies;</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply the terms applicable to the Fidesium service and any other documents referred to in them; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Fidesium, our users, or others.

							<p>To third parties to market their products or services to you if you have consented. We contractually require these third parties to keep personal data confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>
					<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our service providers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Platform, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Platform; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
					<h3>Data retention</h3>
					<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of a dispute in respect to our relationship with you.</p>
					<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.</p>
					<h2>Your Rights</h2>
					<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>
					<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@Fidesium.xyz">info@Fidesium.xyz</a> or <a href="https://Fidesium.xyz/privacy">https://Fidesium.xyz/privacy</a>.</p>
					<p>You have the right to:</p>
					<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
					<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
					<p><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
					<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
					<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
					<p>If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
					<p><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
					<p><em>No fee usually required</em></p>
					<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
					<p><em>What we may need from you</em></p>
					<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
					<p><em>Time limit to respond</em></p>
					<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
					<h2>Third Party Platforms</h2>
					<p>Our Platform may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites operated by third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
					<h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.</p>
					<p>Questions, comments and requests regarding this privacy policy are welcomed and should be addressed to <a href="mailto:info@Fidesium.xyz">info@Fidesium.xyz</a>.</p>
